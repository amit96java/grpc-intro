Moved to new project.

RPC Types:
  Unary:
    Simple request response model
  Server Streaming:
    Client send one request and Server returns data in chunks
      ex:
        Amazon (search mobile and it will give multiple data)
        Pagination
  Client Streaming:
    Client sends data in chunks
      ex:
        Upload large file in chunks on server.
  Bi-directional Streaming:
    combination of above two.


Note:
  1) Channel creation is a lazy and costly process.
  2) Use multiple stub for multiple server on single channel.
  3) Channel is an abstract over connection.
